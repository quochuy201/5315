      <h2>What is GIT?</h2>
      <p>GIT is a free and open source software distributed version control system. Git is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>

      <h2>Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>We need a source code version control system to manage the change of all every file within our project source code. The version control system automatically maintains character level changes for all file stored. It remembers the history of our files, so when the conflict happens we can roll back the file to the previous version. VCS helps to share the change, when we have many people work on the same files, it is easier for all team member to know and manage their and others' work.</p>
      <h2>Describe following terms:<br> 1) local repo<br> 2) remote repo<br> 3) how to use GIT in Team Project - multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p>The local repository is the repository in developer's machine for only his/her directly use. The remote repository is typically the repository in another machine (server, cloud) for indirectly use.<br>
        In order to use GIT in Team Project, developers will create a remote repository where they store the entire project files. For developing, each developer will clone the remote repository to he/she computer - local repository and only work directly on these repositories. When developers make changes in their private workplace and after commit, these changes become a part of the repository. Developers can perform many operations between local and remote repository such as add, remove, rename, move, commit, review, roll back file and so more. There are two most important operations in GIT: pull and push. Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repository instance to a local one. The pull is used for synchronization between two repositories. Push operation copies changes from a local repository instance to the remote one. This is used to save the changes permanently into the Git repository.
