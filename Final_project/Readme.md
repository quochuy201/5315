# Final project - Big Data Analytics course

In this use case, I will use Spark Machine learning library MLlib to build a Decision tree classifier model for network attack detection. The use case goal is to help the learner understand how to use Spark ML library, especially the decision tree classifier model. Using Spark MLlib and Spark RDD improves the performance of model in dealing with large datasets. Furthermore, to provide a human-readable result I applied D3js to visualize the decision tree output as a diagram.
